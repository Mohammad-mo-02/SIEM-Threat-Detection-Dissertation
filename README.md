# MSc Dissertation: Analysis of SIEM Log Data for Threat Detection 🛡️  
[![Academic Project](https://img.shields.io/badge/MSc%20Cybersecurity-Dissertation-blueviolet)](https://github.com/Mohammad-mo-02)

This repository documents the full research, design, and analysis process for my MSc Cybersecurity dissertation titled:  
**"Analysis of SIEM Log Data for Threat Detection Using Signature-Based and Machine Learning Techniques."**

The project explores how SIEM systems can be used to detect malicious behaviour across enterprise infrastructure by analysing log data. It compares traditional signature-based detection methods with machine learning models for accuracy, efficiency, and practicality.

## 🎯 Research Objectives

- 🔍 Review the current state of SIEM technologies in modern security operations
- 📊 Analyse SIEM log data to identify patterns and anomalies linked to security threats
- 🔐 Evaluate and compare:
  - Signature-based detection techniques
  - Machine learning-based detection techniques
- 🤖 Benchmark performance of selected ML algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, etc.)
- 🧠 Recommend best practices for security teams based on empirical findings
